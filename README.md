# Moodbooster - An individual project applying different areas of knowledge

This project doesn't focus on a lot of features, but rather focuses on applying a lot of technical concerns I have learned over the course and finding best practices to them.

## Features

Moodbooster is a platform where users can find insipirations quotes that match their interests.

Users can,

- Post their quotes
- Tag them to different groups
- Vote on quotes by others
- Change and delete their own quotes
- Search for quotes by tags

## Technical concerns

- Authentication with OAuth with Facebook and Github auth. This uses `passport` for authentication with different strategies.
- MongoDb for document database. It's easier to change schema quickly.
- Mongoose ORM for abstracting connection to MongoDb.
- `Styled Components` for CSS styling. Because styles live in the same place as the component, reuse styles, create style mixes that work as functions with parameters. All in all, styled components are very extendable.
- CSS Grid for card layout
- Flexbox for other flow layouts

## Things to do

- [x] Authentication with passport
- [x] CRUD quotes
- [x] Tag quotes with hashtags
- [x] Filter quotes by tags
- [x] Filter quotes by user
- [x] Use Context to manage state. This avoids multiple copies of state in different places.
- [x] Use `react-router` for single page routing
- [ ] Authorisation for all endpoints
- [ ] Test coverage
- [ ] Connect to external API for adding more quotes. Ex. zenquotes
- [ ] Frontend and backend validation for data

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
